# VRML-Clock 
Setting alarm using analog clock in virtual reality

My first virtual reality project :-) </br>
The hard part of this project was to make the alarm rings depending on the position of the hour hand not on the PC clock. So when we change the clock in our virtual reality and set a new alarm it still works as supposed to.
